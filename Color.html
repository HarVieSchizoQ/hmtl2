        <h1>Personal Motto</h1>
        <p style="color:red; font-size:20px">Think of a personal motto as a sort of mantra. You might choose one that keeps encouraging you to be the person you want to be, even when you're going through a difficult time. Or, it might help to soothe your soul in the midst of chaos, or remind you to see joy in every situation.</p>
