        <p>Life is a quality that distinguishes matter that has biological processes, such as signaling
            and self-sustaining processes, from that which does not, and is defined by the capacity for
            growth, reaction to stimuli, metabolism, energy transformation, and reproduction.[2][3] 
            Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria.
            Biology is the science that studies life.The gene is the unit of heredity, whereas the cel the

            eukaryotic, both of which consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane and contain many 
            biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Cells reproduce through a process of cell.</p>
